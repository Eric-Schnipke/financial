When deciding which stock to buy and when to buy it, do you find yourself wishing you had some market indicators to guide your decision?  If you do find appropriate market indicators, how do you know when they indicate something will happen with your prospective purchase?  The newly released Maximized OLS Financial Backtester helps solve this problem!

The tool maximizes a set of historical financial data in an Ordinary Least Squares model and outputs the maximized regression summary. The only thing left to do is to output the day shifts that maximize the model and add fit/significance criteria heuristics. Then we'll know which financial indicators our prospective purchases are most sensitive to and (more importantly) when the indicators provide the most predictive power.
