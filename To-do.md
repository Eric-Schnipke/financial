To-Do:

1.) Add indicator inclusion pre-processing algorithm. Test on correlation between the independent variables (if low, add to model) and also correlation between each independent variable and the dependent variable (if high, add to model).
2.) Add output of day shifts for maximized OLS model.
3.) Add option to print output to PDF report.
4.) Create day offset recognition algorithm to recognize when maximizing day offset is occuring in market.
